Using the utilization of HTML, CSS, and JS I created a etch-a-sketch like program. Complete with buttons that can toggle between different color modes. The default being black. Black opacity is a mode that increase in opacity for each pass using black. Lastly, the color mode generates random RGB colors.

A loop wsa used to generate the grid, while event listeners were used to change the color of a specific pixel. Functions were frequently used to organize and improve the readability of the JS file.

There is also a slider than can change the dimensions of the canvas/etch-a-sketch area. The reset button clears this area.

The majority of the logic was created using JS, focusing on the concepts that were covered in the JS section of The Odin Project. This is the second project in the JS section of the foundations course. Basic CSS flexbox was also utilized in this project.
